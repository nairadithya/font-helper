This is a very simple font installer script, mainly for personal use.

Note: The default place this moves fonts to is "~/.local/share/fonts/"

This works well for my setup on Fedora. Change the =font_dir= variable in the beginning of the file to suit your preferences or system. 

** Usage

#+begin_src bash
font-helper.py path/to/zip-file
#+end_src

** Stuff to do
- Pasting the URL to the .zip file just to cleanup stuff.
